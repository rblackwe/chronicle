The chronicle blog compiler
---------------------------

  Chronicle is a tool which will convert a directory of simple
 text files into a static HTML weblog, (or blog if you prefer).

  The system is intentionally simple, but it does support:

  * Template based output.
  * Support for RSS feeds.
  * Support for tagged entries.
  * Optional support for comments.




Installation
------------

  It is possible to run the software without installing it, just
 by placing blog entries in the ./blog directory and running
 ./bin/chronicle.

  However it is recommended you install the software system-wide
 by running "make install" as root.

  This will give you:

    /usr/share/chronicle        <-  The theme directories.
    /usr/bin/chronicle          <-  The main binary.
    /usr/bin/chronicle-spooler  <-  A simple helper.
    /etc/chroniclerc            <-  The global configuration file.

  If you wish to customise the templates it is recommended you
 make a copy of them with a new name, then edit that copy.  This
 will prevent changes from being overwritten on upgrade.

  The configuration file may be copied to ~/.chroniclerc for
 per-user configuration.



Blog Format
-----------

  The blog format is very simple.  Each file should start like this:

  /--
   title:  The title of my post
   date: 12 August 2007
   tags: foo, bar, baz

   The text of the actual entry goes here.

   However much there is of it.
  \--



  The entries are aided by a pseudo-header.  This header contains
 entries which are used by Chronicle to build your blog.  The entries
 themselves are not included in your output HTML.

Title:
   This holds the name of the post.  ("Subject:" may be used as a synonym.)
   If neither "Title" or "Subject" are present the filename itself is
 used.


Date:
   The date this entry was created.  If not present the creation time
 of the file is used.


Publish:
  If you make use of the spooler, to automatically post pre-written entries
 on particular days, this field will specify when an entry is made live.


Tags:
   If any tags are present they will be used to categorise the entry.



Entry Cutting
-------------

  If you wish you may truncate a long entry via the special <cut> tag,
 for example:.


/--------------------------\
This is a line of text
<cut>This is hidden
So is this
</cut>
This is displayed.
\==========================/


  Or, with specific test:

/-------------------------------------------------\
This is a line of text
<cut text="Click to read more...">This is hidden
So is this
</cut>
This is displayed.
\=================================================/



Comment Support
---------------

  The system supports the submission of user-supplied comments upon
 posts, for more details please see the included file COMMENTS.



Bugs?
-----

  Please report bugs to the author, where they will be fixed as
 quickly as possible.
