Migrating to Chronicle
----------------------

  Included with this release is the utility script `chronicle-rss-importer`
 which will allow you to import any entries which are available as an
 RSS feed from your current platform.

  Usage is as simple as:

    chronicle-rss-importer --feed=http://blog.steve.org.uk/index.rss \
     --output=/path/to/write/entries/to   [--sequential]

  This will fetch the remote feed, parse it into individual entries and
 write each on out to a new file beneath the specified output directory.
